    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents how to construct the Ultimate Forward Rate term structures, as prescribed by the Dutch National Bank (DNB), using the open source financial library `QuantLib`. It demonstrates the procedure to build term structures and to compute basic risk metrics. Also, a brief summary of the methodology is given to better understand the implementation.\n",

    "\n",
    "# FTK Curve Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, before constructing the Ultimate Forward Rate curve, we need to bootstrap a term structure using the market input. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DNB-FTK methodology gives clear instructions regarding the market instruments that should be used, as well as the interpolation algorithm to be applied between the nodal points. The eligible market rates are CMPL Euribor 6m swaps (BID prices) for tenors 1 - 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The required interpolation method assumes flat annually compounded forward rate, which can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "(1+z(t,T_{i}))^{T_{i}-t} \\times (1 + f(t,T_{i},T_{i+1}))^{(T_{i+1} - T_{i})} = (1+z(t,T_{i+1}))^{T_{i+1}-t},\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $z(t,T_{i})$ is the zero (annually compounded) rate with maturity at time $T_{i}$ and $f(t,T_{i},T_{i+1})$ is the annually compounded forward rate between $T_{i}$ and $T_{i+1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The forward rate can be equivalently expressed in terms of discount factors as,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "(1 + f(t,T_{i},T_{i+1}))^{(T_{i+1} - T_{i})} = \\left [ \\frac{P(t,T_{i})}{P(t,T_{i+1})} \\right ],\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "because each discount factor can be presented as a function of annually compounded zero rate: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "P(t,T_{i}) = (1+z(t,T_{i}))^{-(T_{i}-t)}.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpolation used in the FTK curve assumes that between nodal points $[T_{i}, T_{i+1}]$ the annually compounded forward rate is constant. This can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "P(t,T) = P(t,T_{i}) \\times (1 + \\underbrace{f(t,T_{i},T_{i+1})}_{\\text{constant}})^{-(T - T_{i})}, \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_{i} \\leq T \\leq T_{i+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the previous equation, we can relate the interpolated discount factor entirely to the neighbouring discount factors at nodes: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "P(t,T) = P(t,T_{i}) \\times \\left[ \\frac{P(t,T_{i})}{P(t,T_{i+1})}\\right]^{\\frac{T_{i} - T}{T_{i+1} - T_{i}}},\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_{i} \\leq T \\leq T_{i+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consideration which may simplify the implementation is an observation that the above interpolation scheme is equivalent to interpolating linearly on log-discounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "That scheme can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\log P(t,T) = \\log P(t,T_{i})  + \\frac{T - T_{i}}{T_{i+1} - T_{i}} [\\log P(t, T_{i+1}) - \\log P(t, T_{i})],\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_{i} \\leq T \\leq T_{i+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some reorganization of the equation we obtain,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\log P(t,T) = \\frac{T_{i+1} - T}{T_{i+1} - T_{i}} \\log P(t,T_{i})  + \\frac{T - T_{i}}{T_{i+1} - T_{i}} \\log P(t, T_{i+1}).\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using basic properties of a logarithmic function we get,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\log P(t,T) = \\log \\left [ P(t,T_{i})^{\\frac{T_{i+1} - T}{T_{i+1} - T_{i}}} \\right ] + \\log \\left [ P(t, T_{i+1})^{ \\frac{T - T_{i}}{T_{i+1} - T_{i}}}\\right ].\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "Taking the exponent on both sides of the equation and reorganizing according to the properties of an exponential function,\n",
